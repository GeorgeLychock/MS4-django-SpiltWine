# Use Case
StreetHeat v1.0 is a patented garment accessory that provides a user extra comfort by attaching a heating or cooling element to an existing piece of clothing, such as a scarf. The product website should show a prospective customer where they can purchase StreetHeat in proximaty to their current location while also providing the visitor with their location's current weather, traffic conditions, and a map that displays locations of coffee houses, soup shops, ice cream shops, smoothie shops or other establishments a user might be interested in when trying to battle the elements. A visitor should be able to view a product page on a specific version of StreetHeat as well as a means to purchase the product online.

> ### Important Notes
>
>-  The primary focus of this project is to display Django, Python, and database skills learned in the Full Stack Frameowrks with Django module of the Salem State University / Code Institute Full Stack Software Developer Certificate Program.
